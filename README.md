**WARNING**: This project is not maintained anymore.

This is a CouchDB client for Go, it focuses on basic operations, proper conflict management, error handling and replication. 

Not yet part of this are attachment handling, general statistics and optimizations, change detection and creating views. Most of the features are accessible using the generic Do() function, though.

Suggestions and critique are welcome.
